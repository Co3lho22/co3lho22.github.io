Building machine learning models in Rust involves leveraging the language's safety and performance features. In this guide, we cover the entire process from data preparation to model deployment.

### Data Preparation
Data preparation is a critical step in machine learning. Using Rust, you can efficiently handle large datasets and perform data cleaning, transformation, and augmentation.

### Model Training
Training ML models in Rust can be done using various libraries. This section explores some of the popular Rust libraries for machine learning and provides examples of how to use them.

### Model Evaluation
After training, evaluating the model's performance is essential. Rust's robust testing framework helps ensure your models perform as expected.

### Deployment
Deploying ML models involves creating a service that can handle predictions. Rust's performance and concurrency features make it an excellent choice for building scalable ML services.
